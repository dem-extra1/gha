# Changelog

All notable changes to `d-morrison/gha` are documented here.

This repo uses a **moving major tag** (`v1`) for consumers, following the
[`r-lib/actions`](https://github.com/r-lib/actions) convention: the `v1` tag
moves forward as non-breaking fixes land, and consumers pin to `@v1`. Each
release is also tagged with a full `vX.Y.Z` so a specific point can be pinned
if needed. Breaking changes bump the major tag (`v2`, …) and are called out
below with migration steps.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `quarto-publish` — render a Quarto site and deploy it to GitHub Pages. A
  composite (`quarto-publish/action.yml`) sets up Quarto (optionally R/renv and
  TinyTeX), renders a project at a given `path`, and stages the rendered output
  (`<path>/<output-dir>`, default `_site`) as a Pages artifact. The reusable
  workflow (`quarto-publish.yml`) adds the deploy, optional submodule init, and
  a `pre-render-artifact` input so a caller can inject build-time assets (e.g.
  recorded media) before render. First consumer: `Lacaedemon/sparta` (#37).
- `check-phi` — scans pull requests (added lines only; whole tree on `push`)
  for content that looks like PHI: US Social Security numbers, medical record
  numbers, dates of birth, and PHI-suggestive column headers in delimited data
  files. Matched values are never printed to the log; false positives are
  suppressed via a `phi-allow` line comment or a regex allowlist file. The
  `phone`/`email` detectors are available but off by default.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file) — records what changes as the `@v1` tag moves, so
  consumers can see what they picked up.
- `REVDEPS.md` — tracks repos that consume these workflows so breaking changes
  can be announced. See the file for how to register.
- `.github/actions/checkout-submodules` composite action — centralizes the
  submodule-init logic (the `SUBMODULES_TOKEN` `insteadOf` rewrite and the
  anonymous-clone fallback) shared by the `claude` and `claude-code-review`
  reusable workflows (#25).

### Changed

- Multi-line `run:` blocks in the composite actions and reusable workflows now
  declare `set -euo pipefail` explicitly. GitHub already runs `shell: bash`
  with `-eo pipefail`; the net new protection is `nounset` (unset-variable
  typos now fail fast), plus consistency with the rest of the script logic.
- `claude` and `claude-code-review` no longer carry duplicate `Checkout
  submodules` steps; both call the shared `checkout-submodules` action instead,
  so the token-rewrite logic lives in one place (#25).
- `check-bibliography-dois` now collects `.bib` files NUL-delimited into a bash
  array, so bibliography paths containing spaces are passed to the checker as
  intact single arguments instead of word-splitting (#30).

### Fixed

- `claude-code-review` now sets `allowed_bots: github-actions[bot]`, so the
  review `claude.yml` re-dispatches after an `@claude` run pushes commits can
  actually run. The action's agent mode (used by `workflow_dispatch`) blocks
  bot actors by default, so dispatched reviews previously failed with "Workflow
  initiated by non-human actor" — and, having entered the per-PR concurrency
  group, canceled the parallel `synchronize` auto-review on their way out,
  leaving the push with no review at all.
- `claude-code-review`'s "collapse previous review comments" step is no longer
  gated to `pull_request`, so a dispatched (`workflow_dispatch`) review that
  wins the per-PR concurrency race also folds earlier pushes' review comments as
  OUTDATED instead of leaving them expanded.

## [v1] — initial pilot set

Reusable workflows + composite actions:

- `check-bibliography-dois` — validate book/article BibTeX entries have
  resolvable DOIs matching CrossRef metadata.
- `check-links` — lychee link check with bundled config, PR skip-label, and
  auto-issue on `main`.
- `check-non-standard-chars` — detect curly quotes / en–em dashes in `.qmd`
  and `.R` files.
- `check-news` — enforce a `NEWS.md` changelog entry on PRs (wraps
  `UCD-SERG/changelog-check-action`).
- `summary` — AI summary comment on newly opened issues.
