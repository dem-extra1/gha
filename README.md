# d-morrison/gha

Central, reusable GitHub Actions for d-morrison / UCD-SERG / ucdavis R-package
and Quarto repositories. Modeled on
[`r-lib/actions`](https://github.com/r-lib/actions) and
[`easystats/workflows`](https://github.com/easystats/workflows): repos call a
reusable workflow with a tiny stub instead of carrying their own copy.

This repo is **public** so it can be referenced from repositories across the
`d-morrison`, `ucdavis`, `UCD-SERG`, `UCLA-PHP`, and `UCD-IDDRC` owners.

## How it works

Each capability is shipped as two layers:

- **Composite action** (e.g. `check-bibliography-dois/action.yml`) — bundles the
  real steps and any helper script. Referenced as
  `d-morrison/gha/<name>@v1`.
- **Reusable workflow** (`.github/workflows/<name>.yml`, `on: workflow_call`) —
  wraps the composite, declares permissions, and checks out the caller's repo.
  This is what consumer repos target.

A consumer repo adds a small caller stub (see [`examples/`](examples)):

```yaml
name: Check Bibliography DOIs
on:
  push: { branches: [main] }
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  check:
    uses: d-morrison/gha/.github/workflows/check-bibliography-dois.yml@v1
```

Pin to `@v1` (a moving major tag updated as fixes land). Do not reference
`@main` from consumers.

## Available reusable workflows

| Workflow | Purpose | Key inputs |
|---|---|---|
| `check-bibliography-dois.yml` | Validate book/article BibTeX entries have resolvable DOIs matching CrossRef metadata | `exclude-keys`, `install-quarto`, `no-metadata-check` |
| `check-non-standard-chars.yml` | Detect curly quotes / en–em dashes in `.qmd` and `.R` files | `python-version` |
| `check-phi.yml` | Scan PRs (added lines only) for content that looks like PHI — SSNs, medical record numbers, dates of birth, PHI column headers in data files | `detectors`, `paths-ignore`, `allowlist-file`, `fail` |
| `check-links.yml` | lychee link check with bundled config, PR skip-label, and auto-issue on `main` | `lychee-config`, `lychee-args`, `fail-if-empty`, `create-issue-on-main`, `skip-label` |
| `summary.yml` | AI summary comment on newly opened issues | — |
| `check-news.yml` | Enforce a `NEWS.md` changelog entry on PRs (wraps `UCD-SERG/changelog-check-action`) | `changelog` |
| `claude.yml` | Agent-mode Claude Code bot: responds to `@claude` mentions, edits files, opens/updates PRs | `setup-r`, `install-quarto`, `use-renv`, `apt-packages`, `pip-packages`, `checkout-submodules`, `link-skills`, `eager-pr`, `prompt-addendum`, `webfetch-allowlist-url`, `reviewer` |
| `claude-code-review.yml` | Read-only Claude PR review (runs the `code-review` plugin; inline findings on `pull_request` runs, consolidated summary on dispatched runs) | `pr-number`, `prompt-addendum`, `checkout-submodules`, `allowed-bots` |
| `quarto-publish.yml` | Render a Quarto site and deploy it to GitHub Pages | `path`, `setup-r`, `r-packages`, `use-renv`, `tinytex`, `apt-packages`, `output-dir`, `checkout-submodules`, `pre-render-artifact`, `pre-render-artifact-path`, `deploy` |
| `preview.yml` | Build half of the PR-preview family: render a Quarto site in the (possibly fork) PR context and upload it + PR metadata as an artifact (read-only) | `r-version`, `apt-packages`, `use-renv`, `install-package`, `setup-chrome`, `submodules`, `render-profile` |
| `preview-deploy.yml` | Deploy half: on `workflow_run` completion of the build, publish the artifact to `gh-pages` and comment the preview link (base-repo context) | — |
| `cleanup-pr-previews.yml` | Housekeeping: delete `gh-pages` preview directories for PRs that are no longer open | `preview-dir` |
| `bump-submodule.yml` | Update a named submodule to its upstream HEAD and open a PR when the pointer moves | `submodule-path`, `remote-branch`, `base-branch`, `pr-branch` |
| `sync-shared-fragments.yml` | Vendor files from an upstream repo (pinned to a commit, recorded in a manifest) and open a PR when they change — avoids a recursive mutual submodule | `source-repo`, `source-ref`, `source-paths`, `dest-dir`, `manifest-path` |

## Permissions

A called reusable workflow cannot hold more `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions than the
caller grants, and most repos default to a **read-only** token. So workflows
that need to write must have the **caller** grant it on the calling job:

- `check-links` (opens an issue on `main` failures) → grant `issues: write`,
  `pull-requests: read`, `contents: read`.
- `summary` (comments on issues, calls the models API) → grant `issues: write`,
  `models: read`, `contents: read`.
- `check-bibliography-dois`, `check-non-standard-chars`, `check-phi` → only
  `contents: read` (the default), so no `permissions:` block is needed.
- `quarto-publish` (deploys to GitHub Pages) → grant `pages: write`,
  `id-token: write`, `contents: read`, and set Settings → Pages → Source =
  "GitHub Actions" once. Build-only callers (`deploy: false`) need just
  `contents: read`.
- `claude` (pushes branches, opens PRs, dispatches the review workflow) → grant
  `contents: write`, `pull-requests: write`, `issues: write`, `id-token: write`,
  `actions: write`, and add the `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` secret.
  - **Optional:** if Claude will edit files under `.github/workflows/`, also add
    a `WORKFLOW_TOKEN` secret (a PAT or GitHub App token with `contents:write` +
    `workflows:write`). The integrated `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot push workflow-file
    changes — GitHub rejects them without the `workflows` scope. Repos that never
    touch `.github/workflows/` can omit it; pushes fall back to `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
    Note that, unlike `GITHUB_TOKEN`, a PAT/App-token push **does** trigger other
    `push`-based workflows, so enabling `WORKFLOW_TOKEN` can set off extra CI runs.
  - **Optional:** set `checkout-submodules: true` so Claude can read submodule
    contents. Public submodules clone anonymously; private ones additionally need
    a `SUBMODULES_TOKEN` secret.
- `claude-code-review` (read-only review) → grant `contents: read`,
  `pull-requests: write`, `issues: write`, `id-token: write`, and the
  `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` secret.
  - **Optional:** set `checkout-submodules: true` so the reviewer can read
    submodule contents instead of reporting them as uninitialized. Public
    submodules clone anonymously; private ones additionally need a
    `SUBMODULES_TOKEN` secret.
- `preview` (build half, read-only) → only `contents: read` (the default).
- `preview-deploy` (deploy half, pushes `gh-pages` + comments) → grant
  `contents: write`, `pull-requests: write`, `actions: read`.
- `cleanup-pr-previews` (commits deletions to `gh-pages`) → grant
  `contents: write`, `pull-requests: read`.
- `bump-submodule`, `sync-shared-fragments` (open a PR) → grant `contents: write`,
  `pull-requests: write`, and enable Settings → Actions → General → "Allow
  GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" so the integrated
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` can open the PR. For private submodules, `bump-submodule` also
  needs a `SUBMODULES_TOKEN` secret. Add a `WORKFLOW_TOKEN` only to push to a
  protected branch; otherwise pushes fall back to `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

The stubs in [`examples/`](examples) already include the right `permissions:`
blocks — copy them as-is.

The two Claude workflows are a pair: an `@claude review` mention (or any commit
Claude pushes) routes through `claude.yml`, which dispatches `claude-code-review.yml`
via `workflow_dispatch`. Install both, and keep the review stub named
`claude-code-review.yml` (or set `claude.yml`'s `review-workflow-file` input to
match) so the dispatch resolves.

## PHI scanning (`check-phi`)

`check-phi` is a **heuristic tripwire, not a HIPAA compliance tool.** It flags
patterns that should almost never be committed — US Social Security numbers,
medical record numbers, dates of birth, and PHI-suggestive column headers in
delimited data files (`.csv`/`.tsv`/`.psv`) — so a human reviews before the
data merges. It is tuned for high precision (few false positives), so it will
miss free-text PHI such as patient names. The `phone` and `email` detectors
exist but are **off by default** (too noisy in source); enable them via the
`detectors` input.

- **Diff-scoped on PRs.** Only lines *added* by the PR are scanned, so existing
  fixtures don't re-trip the check on unrelated edits. `push` runs scan the
  whole tracked tree (`git ls-files`).
- **Values are never printed.** A leaked identifier in a CI log is still a leak,
  so findings report only `file:line:col` and the detector name — never the
  matched text. Findings appear as inline annotations on the PR.
- **Suppressing false positives** (e.g. synthetic test data): add a `phi-allow`
  comment on the line, or list a regex matching the value in an allowlist file
  (defaults to `.github/phi-allowlist.txt` when present; override with the
  `allowlist-file` input). Use `fail: false` to downgrade to warnings.

## PR previews (`preview` family)

The PR-preview family publishes a rendered Quarto site for each open PR to a
`pr-preview/pr-<n>/` directory on `gh-pages`. It is **three** cooperating
workflows — install all three stubs from [`examples/`](examples):

1. **`preview.yml`** (build) — triggered on `pull_request`. Renders the site and
   uploads it plus the PR metadata as a `pr-preview-site` artifact. Runs
   **read-only** in the (possibly fork) PR context, so it can't write to the
   base repo.
2. **`preview-deploy.yml`** (deploy) — triggered on `workflow_run` completion of
   the build. Downloads the artifact and publishes it to `gh-pages` in the
   **base-repo** context (where the token can write), then comments the preview
   link on the PR.
3. **`cleanup-pr-previews.yml`** (housekeeping) — scheduled. Removes preview
   directories for PRs that have closed.

The build/deploy split is a **trust boundary**: untrusted fork code only ever
runs in the read-only build half, while the privileged `gh-pages` push happens
in the deploy half against base-repo code. Don't collapse them into one job.

Two wiring requirements:

- The deploy stub's `on: workflow_run: workflows:` value **must match the
  build stub's `name:`** (both default to `Quarto Preview Build` in the
  examples). That string is how `workflow_run` finds the build.
- `workflow_run` and `schedule` triggers only fire for the copy of the file on
  the **default branch**, so previews and cleanup don't take effect until the
  stubs are merged to `main`.

The build half is parameterized for non-rme consumers (R version, the apt
package list, renv on/off, `R CMD INSTALL .` on/off, Chrome, submodules, render
profile). Label-gated extras are preserved: add `preview:pdf`, `preview:docx`,
or `preview:revealjs` to a PR to render those formats too, and `clear freezer`
to bypass the Quarto freeze cache.

## Shared-content sync (`bump-submodule` + `sync-shared-fragments`)

Two repos can share single-source-of-truth content and keep both copies current
without hand-bumping. The pair handles the two directions:

- **`bump-submodule`** — for the side that vendors the other repo as a git
  submodule. A scheduled run advances the submodule to its upstream HEAD and
  opens a PR when it moved. (Used by `UCD-SERG/lab-manual`, which carries
  `d-morrison/ai-config` as `.ai-config`.)
- **`sync-shared-fragments`** — for the side that can't add a submodule because
  the other repo already submodules *it* (a mutual submodule would recurse).
  Instead it vendors a pinned **copy** of the named files into a `dest-dir`,
  records the source repo and commit in a JSON manifest, and opens a PR when the
  copy changes. (Used by `d-morrison/ai-config` to vendor the lab manual's
  authored fragments.) Don't hand-edit the vendored copies — edit them upstream
  and let the workflow refresh them; a consumer-side drift check can assert the
  copy matches the pinned commit.

Both reuse the `open-sync-pr` composite, which commits staged changes to a
reused automation branch and opens or updates one PR (no-op when nothing
changed). Schedule and `workflow_dispatch` triggers live in the caller stubs.
Path-filter or scope each side to the *other* repo's shared content (not its own
pointer/manifest) so the two auto-PRs don't ping-pong.

## Versioning

Releases are tagged `vX.Y.Z`; the `vX` major tag moves to the latest compatible
release. Consumers reference `@v1`. See [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for what
changes as the `@v1` tag moves and for any breaking-change migration steps.

### Pinning third-party actions

Every **third-party** action is pinned to a full commit SHA, with the
human-readable version in a trailing comment, e.g.:

```yaml
uses: actions/checkout@9c091bb21b7c1c1d1991bb908d89e4e9dddfe3e0 # v7.0.0
```

This is GitHub's [recommended hardening posture](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-third-party-actions):
a SHA is immutable, so a re-pointed tag or a compromised upstream can't silently
change what runs — which matters here because jobs like the preview deploy run
with `contents: write` + `pull-requests: write`. [`.github/dependabot.yml`](.github/dependabot.yml)
bumps these pins as upstreams publish releases, so they stay current instead of
freezing. When adding a new third-party action, pin it the same way.

First-party `d-morrison/gha/*@v1` self-references and the [`examples/`](examples/)
templates intentionally track the `@v1` major tag (so consumers ride the moving
major), and so are **not** SHA-pinned.

## Reverse dependencies

[`REVDEPS.md`](REVDEPS.md) tracks repos that call these workflows, so consumers
can be notified before a breaking change. If your repo uses `gha`, please add
it there.

## Notes for private consumers

Reusable workflows in this public repo are callable from public repos
automatically. A **private** consumer must allow access to this repo under
*Settings → Actions → General → Access* before it can call these workflows.

## Scope

This started as the pilot set (the byte-identical / near-identical workflow
families) plus the PR-preview/publish family. Additional families (spell check,
lint-changed-files, pr-commands, R-CMD-check) may be added later.
